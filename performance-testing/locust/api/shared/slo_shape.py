    Step-1 (isolated) ramp-to-breach-then-soak shape, driven by
    ENDPOINT_SLO_P95_MS / ENDPOINT_SLO_P99_MS (loaded from env.sh, not
    hardcoded -- see documentation/staff-api/test-scenarios.md §4/§5). A
    scenario fires endpoints from several different SLO classes in one run
    (e.g. register_read touches Metadata-Read and Register-Search), so this
    checks each endpoint against its own class's SLOs, not the whole run
    against one number.

    Starts with warmup_seconds at warmup_users with NO SLO checks (cold
    cache / first-connection noise is discarded). Then ramps +step_users
    every step_seconds. Once any tracked endpoint (with enough *successful*
    samples this step) breaches its own p95 OR p99 SLO, the ramp freezes at
    that user count and holds steady there for sustain_seconds, then stops.
    If max_users is reached with no breach, it stops immediately without a
    soak.

    503s/other failures are logged but do NOT stop or freeze the ramp, and
    do NOT feed the p95/p99 calculation used to decide a breach either --
    only successful requests' response times count toward SLO checks (a
    failed request's "response time" -- e.g. a near-instant connection
    reset -- isn't a real latency sample, and Locust's own
    get_current_response_time_percentile() would otherwise silently mix
    failed and successful requests together). This shape tracks its own
    per-step, success-only response-time samples via a `request` event
    listener rather than relying on that built-in.

    NOTE: -u/-r/-t are ignored by Locust once a custom shape is active (see
    COMMON_OPTIONS in locust/main.py) -- this class owns its entire stop
    condition, including the max_users safety net.

    NOTE: register_read's get_record_history has a known upstream bug
    (SYS-ERR-001 -- see documentation/seeding-design.md) causing 100%
    failures. It's deliberately excluded from REGISTER_READ_ENDPOINTS in
    env.sh (commented-out toggle to re-add it once fixed) -- since failures
    no longer freeze/stop the ramp on their own, this is now a labeling
    concern rather than a ramp-killer, but it's still excluded to keep
    register_read's failure log free of a known, unrelated noise source.
